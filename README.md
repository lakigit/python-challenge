Module Challenge week3
Here complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll

**PyBank**
For PyBank, the challenge is creating a Python script to analyse the company's financial records.  
The dataset has two columns: column 1 is "Date" and column 2 is"Profit/Losses".
Here we analyse: 
          Total months: length of column 1,
          Total: sum of column 2. Here column 2 data type is not an integer. So need to convert them to the integer type, 
          Average change,
          Greatest Increase in Profits,
          Greatest Decrease in Profits,
In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

**PyPoll**
In this Challenge, tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.
Here we analyse:
         The total number of votes cast,
         A complete list of candidates who received votes,
         The percentage of votes each candidate won,
         The total number of votes each candidate won,
         The winner of the election based on the popular vote, 
Here also, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the result
